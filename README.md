# Virtualization

# The Mission

Due to the recent growth of the company you work at, a lot of services have been implemented. So far it has been your team's job to deploy and maintain them, but it's now to the point that nobody dares touching the server for fear of breaking anything.

In an ideal world you'd need a way to compartmentalize and make all of those services easily reproducible. Hopefully, and if the rumor you've heard are true, that ideal world may not be that far off.

Indeed, to solve the issue your manager asked you to research virtualization, a technology that, on paper, promises to solve all your problems. He provided you with a list of keywords to get started (see below) and gave you two days to produce a report.

- VM (virtual machines)

- Linux cgroups and namespaces

- Application Containers

- Vagrant

- hypervisor

- Docker

- Proxmox

- Podman

- System Containers

- LXC

- Kubernetes

- ESXi
...
It's now your job to gather as much information as possible and investigate if the technology is worth diving more time into. In order to validate this challenge you will have to make a pull request with your report explaining what virtualization is and why it is, or not, a set of technology worth investing time into.

NOTE: If you find yourself with some spare time, feel free to dive into the technologies you researched and try to use them.
